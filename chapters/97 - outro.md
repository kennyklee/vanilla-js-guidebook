# What now?

It's my hope that by this point, you're feeling a lot more comfortable writing vanilla JavaScript.

If you stick with it, soon vanilla JS will feel more natural to write than jQuery. In the not too distant future, vanilla JS will feel like second nature, and you'll need to pull up the jQuery docs every time you need to work with it.

## How to keep learning

Here are some thoughts on how to keep building your vanilla JavaScript skills:

1. Convert a few of your jQuery scripts into vanilla JS. It's often easier to get started when you're refactoring existing code.
2. Pick a random project from the list below and start coding. You'll mess up a lot and learn a ton.
3. Look for vanilla JS open source projects. Look at thow their authors structure their code. Contribute to them if you can or want to. Ask questions.
4. Browse the Q&A for `vanilla JS` on Stack Overflow.^[[http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=vanilla+js](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=vanilla+js)]
5. Read the Mozilla Developer Network's JavaScript documentation.^[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)] I would probably do this in conjunction with items #1 and #2.


## Vanilla JS Project Ideas

Some ideas to get you started.

- **Toggle Tabs.** Clicking on a tab shows it's content and hides other tab content in that tab group.
- **Modals.** Clicking on a link or button opens a modal window. Clicking a close button (or outside of the modal) closes it.
- **Save Form Data.** Click a "Save this Form" button to save all of the data in a form. Reloading the page causes the form to repopulate with the already completed data.
- **Password Visibility.** Clicking a button or a checkbox makes a password field visibile. Clicking it again (or unchecking the box) masks the password in the field again.
- **Same Height.** Set all content areas in a group to the same height. If they're stacked one-on-top-of-the-other, let me reset to their default height.
- **Notifications.** Click a button to make a notification message appear on the page. Click an "X" in the notification to remove it. Let the notification text get set dynamically via some data on the button that toggles it.


## How to find vanilla JS open source projects

I'm maintaining a growing list of third-party vanilla JavaScript plugins on the Ditching jQuery Resources page ([https://ditchingjquery.com/resources/](https://ditchingjquery.com/resources/)). That's a great place to start.

You can also just google, `{type of script you're looking for} vanilla js`. A lot of impressive plugins either don't require jQuery, or offer both jQuery and vanilla JS versions.


## Don't feel like you have to go 100% vanilla JS immediately

You'll go crazy. I tried doing this. It's *really* hard.

Migrate your projects over time. Look for vanilla JS alternatives when possible.

Never stop learning.
