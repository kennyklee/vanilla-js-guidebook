# ECMAScript 5

ECMAScript 5, more commonly known as ES5, is a more modern iteration of JavaScript was approved in 2011 and added a ton of useful functions and APIs that hadn't previously existed.

At the time of writing, ES6 is the latest iteration, ES7 (now called ES2016) is in the works, and new versions are coming every year. ES6 and beyond lack strong backwards browser compatibility, however, and the resulting code looks very different from traditional JavaScript.

As a result, we'll be focusing on ES5 functions and APIs, which are incredibly well supported and provide a dependency-free development experience..
