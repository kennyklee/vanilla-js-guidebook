# ECMAScript 5

ECMAScript 5, more commonly known as ES5, is a more modern iteration of JavaScript that added a ton of useful APIs that hadn't previously existed.

Many modern web and ECMAScript 5 APIs wouldn't exist at all if jQuery hadn't grown so popular and pushed demand for them. It's made working on the web much easier. Thanks jQuery!

At the time of writing, ES6 is the latest iteration, ES7 (now called ES2016) is in the works, and new versions are coming every year. ES6 and beyond lack strong backwards browser compatibility, however, and the resulting code looks very different from traditional JavaScript and jQuery.

As a result, we'll be focusing on ES5 APIs, which are incredibly well supported and are the perfect place to start for someone transitioning from jQuery to vanilla JavaScript.
