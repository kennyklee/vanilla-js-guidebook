# Intro

A few years ago, I was a front end developer who was completely overwhelmed by JavaScript.

I'd search StackOverflow for solutions, copy/paste code, and just hope that it would work. Most of the time it wouldn't. When it did, I had no idea how or why. Does this sound familiar?

Eventually, I started to feel comfortable hacking together some jQuery, but I never felt like I really understood how it worked.

I decided to convert a few of my jQuery scripts into vanilla JavaScript. After a few dozen side projects and a lot of trial **and** error, it finally clicked.

I want to help you learn vanilla JavaScript without all of the painful false starts and roadblocks that I encountered.

## Who this is for

*Ditching jQuery* is for...

- Developers who can hack together some jQuery but don’t feel like they really know JavaScript.
- People who want to write better jQuery (learning vanilla JS will help you code better, period).
- People who want to learn other frameworks--like React or Angular--but don’t feel like they even know where to start.
- Web developers who want to opt-out of the JavaScript framework rat race altogether.
- Front-end developers who want to build websites that are faster and more reliable.


## What you'll learn

This book covers...

- Modern vanilla JavaScript equivalents of common jQuery APIs.
- The easy way to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- How to write scripts that are accessible to everyone.
- How to debug your code when things go wrong.
- A simple trick to make writing JavaScript faster and easier.
- How to put it all together and create real, working scripts.

Along the way, there will be a ton of **labs** where you'll practice what you just learned. At the end, we'll work together to create Invisible Ink, a JavaScript accordion plugin.


## Getting Setup

All of the source code for the lessons in this book are avilable on GitHub ([https://github.com/cferdinandi/ditching-jquery-source-code](https://github.com/cferdinandi/ditching-jquery-source-code)). Each section also includes a lab (the `lab {section name}.html` file), and the answers to the lab (the `lab {section name} answers.html` file).

To make things easier, I've inlined everything. There's some basic CSS up in the `<head>`, some sample `<body>` content to work with, and all of your scripts are down at the bottom.

I make heavy use of `console.log()` to spit out the results of the lessons and labs into the Console tab of Developer Tools. All modern browsers--Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge--have great browser tools baked right in.

I'd also recommend getting a good text editor. My text editor of choice is Sublime 2 ([http://www.sublimetext.com/2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)), but Atom (from GitHub) ([https://atom.io](https://atom.io/)) is a great free cross-platform alternative with most of the same features.
