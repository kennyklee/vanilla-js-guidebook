# Intro

This book is the missing manual for vanilla JavaScript. Youâ€™ll learn...

- Modern vanilla JavaScript equivalents of common tasks you normally use a library or framework for.
- The easy way to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- How to debug your code when things go wrong.
- A simple trick to make writing JavaScript faster and easier.
- How to put it all together and create real, working scripts.

## Getting Setup

All of the source code for the lessons in this book are avilable on GitHub ^[[https://github.com/cferdinandi/vanilla-js-guidebook-source-code](https://github.com/cferdinandi/vanilla-js-guidebook-source-code)].

To make things easier, I've inlined everything. There's some basic CSS up in the `<head>`, some sample `<body>` content to work with, and all of your scripts are down at the bottom.

I make heavy use of `console.log()` in the source code to spit out the results of the lessons into the Console tab of Developer Tools. All modern browsers--Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge--have great browser tools baked right in.

I'd also recommend getting a good text editor. My text editor of choice is Sublime 2^[[http://www.sublimetext.com/2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)], but Atom^[[https://atom.io](https://atom.io/)] (from GitHub) is a great free cross-platform alternative with most of the same features.
