# Play: Getting Started

For our next project, we're going to build a YouTube video player.

We'll have a list of videos, and clicking on one changes the video shown in the player. If the JavaScript file fails to download or isn't supported, visitors should be taken directly to YouTube to watch the video.

And for this project, I want you to try writing the script by yourself, using what you learned creating Invisible Ink.

## I'm here to help

Each section of this project will be broken down into three parts:

1. The tasks I want you to complete.
2. A set of hints and tips to get you started if you're not sure how to move forward.
3. A detailed walk-through of how I approached the tasks and why.

Just like with Invisible Ink, you can find screencasts of me walking through each phase of the project in the `screencasts` directory, and source code for each section in `play` under the `projects` directory.

If you *really* get stuck, feel free to reach out to me directly by email at [chris@gomakethings.com](mailto:chris@gomakethings.com) or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisFerdinandi">@ChrisFerdinandi</a>.

## The Project Sections

Play is broken down into five parts:

1. **The Basics.** Getting a minimally viable script set up.
2. **The Active Video.** Styling and disabling the link to the currently playing video.
3. **Linking to Specific Videos.** Allowing visitors to deep-link to a specific video with custom URLs.
4. **Multiple Players.** Adding support for multiple video players on a single page.
5. **Cleanup.** Adding structure, documentation, and organization to our code.

Ready? Good. Let's get started!
